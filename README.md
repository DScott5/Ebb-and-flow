# Ebb-and-flow

## Project Description:
In this project I created an HTML page for an article I read that discussed web design. I started writing up my page in BBedit using markdown then brought it into dillinger, where I converted it into HTML. I then created a hero image for the page using Adobe Illustrator, and also added an "About the Author" section with an image of myself.
