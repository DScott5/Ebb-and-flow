<p class="bullets">In the article “a dao of web design” by John Allsop, it talks about how the designer
is in complete control with older “traditional” printing methods and mediums. For instance
with newspaper printing or printmaking, you need to print multiple “proofs” or test prints,
before you can get an ideal registration for a final finished print. With web design the
designer must put aside control to accessibility and accommodation for the average user.</p>
</li>
<p class="bullets">Some aesthetic presentation for websites can’t always be constructed exactly how a designer
wants it. The pixels per inch on a site will differ whether it’s being displayed on a Mac or PC
because of hardware differences between the two. Every web designer at some point will struggle
with investing faith in site design visuals. Although the more you can accept the lack of control,
the hindrance will soon become part of the experience.</p>
</li>
<p class="bullets">Once a designer has gotten comfortable with the flow of web design they must decide how
to make their site navigable based on the kind of site they are creating. Instead of sketching up
a plan designers should get messy and experiment. That way you never have to worry about trying so
hard to perfect an idea you had.</p>
