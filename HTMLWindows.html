<ul>
<li>In the article “a dao of web design” by John Allsop, it talks about how the designer</li>
</ul>
<p>is in complete control with older “traditional” printing methods and mediums. For instance</p>
<p>with newspaper printing or printmaking, you need to print multiple “proofs” or test prints,</p>
<p>before you can get an ideal registration for a final finished print. With web design the</p>
<p>designer must put aside control to accessibility and accommodation for the average user.</p>
<ul>
<li>Some aesthetic presentation for websites can’t always be constructed exactly how a designer</li>
</ul>
<p>wants it. The pixels per inch on a site will differ whether it’s being displayed on a Mac or PC</p>
<p>because of hardware differences between the two. Every web designer at some point will struggle</p>
<p>with investing faith in site design visuals. Although the more you can accept the lack of control,</p>
<p>the hindrance will soon become part of the experience.</p>
<ul>
<li>Once a designer has gotten comfortable with the flow of web design they must decide how</li>
</ul>
<p>to make their site navigable based on the kind of site they are creating. Instead of sketching up</p>
<p>a plan designers should get messy and experiment. That way you never have to worry about trying so</p>
<p>hard to perfect an idea you had.</p>
